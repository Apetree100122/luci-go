## LUCI Provenance

Provenance defines APIs for reporting `provenance` metadata, in order to
establish a traceable lineage for artifacts produced within the LUCI ecosystem.
Artifact provenance is otherwise defined as *"metadata which records a snapshot
of the build-time states that correspond to an artifact."*

TODO(akashmukherjee): update this doc.
