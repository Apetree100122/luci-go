// Batch represents a collection of individual work items and associated
// metadata.
//
// Batches are are cut by the Channel according to BatchOptions, and can be
// manipulated by ErrorFn and SendFn.
//
// ErrorFn and SendFn may manipulate the contents of the Batch (Data and Meta)
// to do things such as:
//   * Associate a UID with the Batch (e.g. in the Meta field) to identify it to
//     remote services for deduplication.
//   * Remove already-processed items from Data in case the SendFn partially
//     succeeded.
//
// The dispatcher uses Batch.Len() to account for how many items are currently
// buffered. The length of a Batch is `min(len(Data), Batch's original length)`.
