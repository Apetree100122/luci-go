# The LUCI Change Verifier GAE Service

The LUCI Change Verifier service will be responsible for running
verifications on and submitting CLs that are under review.

TODO(crbug.com/920494): This is unfinished; the docs should
be updated when more of the service is implemented.
See go/luci-cv-design and go/luci-cv-arch-gae for design plans.
