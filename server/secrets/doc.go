// Package secrets provides an interface for a simple secret store: you ask it
// for a secret (a byte blob, identified by some key), and it returns it
// to you (the current version, as well as a bunch of previous versions).
// Callers are supposed to use the secret for an operation and then forget it
// (e.g. do not try to store it elsewhere).
//
// Secure storage, retrieval and rotation of secrets is outside of the scope of
// this interface: it's the responsibility of the implementation.
