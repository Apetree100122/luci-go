// Package dsmapper implements a simple Datastore mapper.
//
// It provides a way to apply some function to all datastore entities of some
// particular kind, in parallel, but with bounded concurrency (to avoid burning
// through all CPU/Datastore quota at once). This may be useful when examining
// or mutating large amounts of datastore entities.
//
// It works by splitting the range of keys into N shards, and launching N worker
// tasks that each sequentially processes a shard assigned to it, slice by
// slice.
