Description:
Used in tests to implement unit test organization and assertions.
Local Modifications:
Added the file README.chromium (this file)

Removed all other files.

Modified prettystr_sub to use string.format instead of custom quoting logic to
allow display of binary data in strings (due to lots of msgpack manipulation).
