def _list_view_entry(ctx, builder = None, *, list_view = None):
    """A builder entry in some luci.list_view(...).

    Can be used to declare that a builder belongs to a list view outside of
    the list view declaration. In particular useful in functions. For example:

        luci.list_view(name = 'Try builders')

        def try_builder(name, ...):
            luci.builder(name = name, ...)
            luci.list_view_entry(list_view = 'Try builders', builder = name)

    Can also be used inline in luci.list_view(...) declarations, for consistency
    with corresponding luci.console_view_entry(...) usage. `list_view` argument
    can be omitted in this case:

        luci.list_view(
            name = 'Try builders',
            entries = [
                luci.list_view_entry(builder = 'Win'),
                ...
            ],
        )

    Args:
      ctx: the implicit rule context, see lucicfg.rule(...).
      builder: a builder to add, see luci.builder(...). Can also be a reference
        to a builder defined in another project. See [Referring to builders in
        other projects](#external_builders) for more details.
      list_view: a list view to add the builder to. Can be omitted if
        `list_view_entry` is used inline inside some luci.list_view(...)
        declaration.
