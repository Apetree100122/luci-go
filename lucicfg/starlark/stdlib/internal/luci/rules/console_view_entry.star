      short_name=None,
      category=None,
      console_view=None
  ):
  """A builder entry in some luci.console_view(...).

  Used inline in luci.console_view(...) declarations to provide `category` and
  `short_name` for a builder. `console_view` argument can be omitted in this
  case:

      luci.console_view(
          name = 'CI builders',
          ...
          entries = [
              luci.console_view_entry(
                  builder = 'Windows Builder',
                  short_name = 'win',
                  category = 'ci',
              ),
              ...
          ],
      )

  Can also be used to declare that a builder belongs to a console outside of
  the console declaration. In particular useful in functions. For example:

      luci.console_view(name = 'CI builders')

      def ci_builder(name, ...):
        luci.builder(name = name, ...)
        luci.console_view_entry(console_view = 'CI builders', builder = name)

  Args:
    builder: a builder to add, see luci.builder(...). Can also be a reference
        to a builder defined in another project. See [Referring to builders in
        other projects](#external_builders) for more details.
    short_name: a shorter name of the builder. The recommendation is to keep
        this name as short as reasonable, as longer names take up more
        horizontal space.
    category: a string of the form `term1|term2|...` that describes the
        hierarchy of the builder columns. Neighboring builders with common
        ancestors will have their column headers merged. In expanded view, each
        leaf category or builder under a non-leaf category will have it's own
        column. The recommendation for maximum densification is not to mix
        subcategories and builders for children of each category.
    console_view: a console view to add the builder to. Can be omitted if
        `console_view_entry` is used inline inside some luci.console_view(...)
        declaration.
