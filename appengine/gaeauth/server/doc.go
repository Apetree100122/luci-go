// Package server implements authentication for inbound HTTP requests on GAE.
// It provides adapters for GAE Users and OAuth2 APIs to make them usable by
// server/auth package.
//
// It also provides GAE-specific implementation of some other interface used
// by server/auth package, such as SessionStore.
//
// By default, gaeauth must have its handlers installed into the "default"
// AppEngine module, and must be running on an instance with read/write
// datastore access.
//
// Deprecated: this package depends on deprecated GAE first-gen APIs.
